                    <p>We undertake the building of ultramodern telecom towers end-to-end, from zoning and
                        site acquisition to delivery to our clients. We build to suit your passive
                        infrastructure, including the site, tower, shelter and power supply. Once the site is
                        built, we assess its colocation potential and explore ways to attract other tenants
                        to lease spaces on it. In areas where acquisition is a challenge, we offer the
                        option of building sites that require smaller land area, such as rooftops.</p>
                    <p>Our Built-to-Suit product offers clients a wide range of solutions tailored to fit
                        their needs and capacity. This product is complemented with our O&amp;M services
                        through which we operate and maintain the sites on behalf of our tenants.
                        This solution offers an array of benefits across the board, from improved quality and
                        range of services to better cash flows management.
                        Built-to-Suit ensures that carriers obtain the telecom infrastructure model they need
                        in order to expand their connectivity and reach remote areas,
                        while considerably reducing costs through saving on capital expenses.</p>
